# React-Project-form (FoodExpress) :rocket:

This is my first shot at creating a react app, it is a static page that contains the use of hooks and react-router-dom to create a 3-page. <br/>
The pages include: <br/>
- [x] Registration Page
- [x] Login form page
- [x] Error page

> #####PS: Please note that the page is not responsive yet, it can only be viewed on a pc :grin: <br/>
> At some point in time later, I'll come back to refactor the code as I progress with my knowledge in react. Thank you for reading :exclamation:
